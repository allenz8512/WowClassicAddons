CCC is a new **CC** tracker for **C**lassic WoW (1.13).

This addon is meant to provide complete and accurate information for stunlocking and controlled sheeping, fearing etc.

The best API available for debuff information only works for the current target, which is not enough for this purpose, so this addon uses different information sources than most other CC/debuff trackers.

* Only the player's own CCs are shown.
* CCs are shown even when the affected unit is not the target.
* CCs are shown even when they start while the affected unit is not the target.
* Reapplication is detected even when the affected unit is not the target.
* Diminishing returns are taken into account.
* Special PvP durations are taken into account.
* Spell ranks, talent bonuses and combo points are taken into account.

Green bars are active debuffs and yellow/orange/red bars are diminishing returns with reduction to 1/2, 1/4 and 0 respectively.
